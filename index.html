          <li>Elements that hold other elements inside are called parent elements and the elements nested inside child elements</li>
          <li>The h1-6 elements are used for headers and the h1 element must only be used once</li>
          <li>The p element is for bodies of text</li>
          <li>ul element is used for unordered lists</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        
        <ul>

          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. 
            Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. 
            We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li> Inline CSS: inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. 
            The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, 
            which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. 
            For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.
              DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
