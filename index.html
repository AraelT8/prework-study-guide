          <li>HTML is the basic framework for a website</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE declaration lets the browser know what to expect on the page.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element not the closing element </li>
          <li>The head element can use the following meta tags:title, style, base, link, script, and meta </li>
          <li>Elements that hold other elements inside are called parent elements and the elements nested inside child elements</li>
          <li>The h1-6 elements are used for headers and the h1 element must only be used once</li>
          <li>The p element is for bodies of text</li>
          <li>ul element is used for unordered lists</li>
          <li>ol element is used for ordered lists</li>
          <li>li element is used for list items</li>
          <li>img element is contains info on the images displayed on the website</li>
          <li>br element is used for creating breaks between lines</li>
          <li>a element is used for creating links to other or the same webpage</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        
        <ul>

          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. 
            Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. 
            We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li> Inline CSS: inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. 
            The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, 
            which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. 
            For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.
              DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>script.js files are linked within the body element</li>
          <li>Conditional statements and loops can be used control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, 
            code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. 
            This location is identified with a unique number called an index. 
            Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is ran.</li>
          <li>You must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
          <li>To call a function, we use the name of the function in our JavaScript file where we want the code to execute.</li>
